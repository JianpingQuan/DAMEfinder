# All data used originated from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-6949/
# NORM1 and CRC1 are a single patient (C1 in ArrayExpress) from this study.
#
# BAM files: 
# BAM files are aligned BS-seq reads from the normal and cancerous tissue of this patient, using the Ensembl GRCH37 genome from ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/grch37/release-91/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/
# The data includes a subset of chromosome 19.
# .bai files are generated with `samtools index <file>`
# See Package vignette for detailed description of alignment with Bismark to obtain BAM files
#
# VCF files:
# SNPs were called with the Bis-SNP tool. They also include a subset of chromosome 19.
#
# tsv.gz files
# Were obtained by running methtuple as described in the vignette.
